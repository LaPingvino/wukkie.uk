# Wukkie.uk - a bug tracker for the world

** oopsie woopsie de trein is stukkie wukkie... **

A privacy-first proof-of-concept project built on Bluesky/ATProto

Why do software projects have quality bug tracking and for world issues we are still dealing with slow and cumbersome political systems? While politicians have their place, I think we need a way to be able to take responsibility together for the problems we encounter around us.

Wukkie.uk is a privacy-by-design platform that allows users to report and track real-world issues using Bluesky's decentralized social infrastructure. The core principle is **privacy-first location handling** - we use geo hashtags that show approximate areas (~1km) instead of precise GPS coordinates, protecting user privacy while enabling effective issue tracking and community coordination.

## Core Features

### Issue Management
- **Create Issues**: Users can report bugs, problems, or improvement suggestions for real-world issues
- **Issue Categories**: Infrastructure, Environment, Social Services, Safety, Transportation, etc.

- **Federated Network**: Multiple servers can interoperate seamlessly
- **No Central Authority**: Distributed governance and content moderation

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Static HTML/CSS/JS**: Simple web interface deployed on Cloudflare Workers/Pages
- **Framework**: Vanilla JS or Alpine.js for simplicity
- **Basic responsive design**: Works on mobile, doesn't need to be perfect

### Backend Services

- **Cloudflare Workers**: Simple API endpoints for location processing
- **Custom Lexicon**: Define issue, vote, and comment record types

## üß™ Testing Architecture & Privacy Validation

### Privacy-First Testing Approach
The testing system ensures our privacy-first location system works correctly while maintaining user anonymity and data protection.

**Core Testing Principles:**
- **58 comprehensive test cases** across location privacy, issue management, and multi-location functionality
- **Case-insensitive geo hashtag validation** - supports `#geo9c3xgp`, `#GEO9C3XGP`, `#Geo9C3XGP` 
- **Plus Code character validation** - only allows valid characters (`23456789CFGHJMPQRVWX`)
- **Privacy boundary testing** - ensures ~1km precision is maintained without GPS leakage
- **Edge case coverage** - malformed input, invalid characters, geographical boundaries

### Test-Driven Development Workflow
```bash
# MANDATORY: All 58 tests must pass before any commit
node test.js                     # Full test suite
node test.js -v                 # Verbose output

# Test Coverage Areas:
# - location-privacy.test.ts (29 tests): Core geo hashtag functionality
# - issue-management.test.ts (14 tests): CRUD operations, location integration  
# - multiple-locations.test.ts (15 tests): Multi-location parsing, validation
```

**Development Requirements:**
- üö® **Zero failing tests** before commits (58/58 must pass)
- üìù **Add tests for new features** (required, not optional)
- üîí **Privacy validation testing** - ensure no GPS coordinates leak
- üåç **Geographic boundary testing** - poles, date line, equator edge cases
- üì± **Case-insensitive support** - comprehensive mixed-case validation

### Privacy Testing Validation
- **Location obfuscation** - verify Plus Codes provide ~1km precision, not exact coordinates
- **Geo hashtag consistency** - same location produces same hashtag across sessions
- **Character validation** - prevent invalid Plus Code characters from breaking privacy
- **Area boundary testing** - ensure location areas have valid geographic bounds
- **Nearby discovery testing** - verify location-based search without exact coordinates

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for complete testing guidelines and best practices.

### Data Storage
- **Bluesky ATProto**: Issues stored as records in user's Bluesky data repository using privacy-preserving location format
- **Browser Storage**: Basic caching and offline capability with geo hashtag indexing
- **Privacy-First Indexing**: Location filtering based on geo hashtag areas, never precise coordinates

### External Integrations
- **OpenStreetMap + Leaflet**: Free mapping and display
- **Browser Geolocation**: Built-in location capture
- **Government APIs**: Add per-issue when relevant (future enhancement)

## Local Hashtag System

### Geographic Relevance Algorithm (Privacy-Preserving)
Building on the WhenWhere.uk Local Hashtag system, Wukkie.uk implements privacy-first geographic filtering:

- **Geo Hashtag Proximity**: Issues ranked by geo hashtag area overlap, not precise distance calculation
- **Administrative Boundaries**: Area-based filtering using geo hashtag hierarchies (city, region, country levels)
- **Configurable Privacy Zones**: User-selectable precision levels (1km, 5km, 25km geo hashtag areas)
- **Auto-tagging**: Automatic generation of geo hashtags from approximate location plus contextual hashtags

### Subject Classification
- **Category Hashtags**: #infrastructure, #environment, #safety, #transport
- **Specific Tags**: #pothole, #graffiti, #noise, #streetlight, #cycling
- **User Tags**: Custom hashtags for community-specific issues
- **Trending Topics**: Algorithm to surface popular local issues

### Relevance Engine
- **Personal Feed**: Weighted algorithm combining location, interests, and activity
- **Discovery Mode**: Explore issues outside your normal filter bubble
- **Notification Settings**: Configurable alerts for specific hashtags/locations
- **Community Clustering**: Identify recurring issues in specific areas

## User Stories

### Basic User (MVP)
"As someone who encounters a problem, I want to quickly post about it with approximate location so others can see it and add their input, while keeping my exact location private."

**Simple Requirements:**
- Create issue with title, description, privacy-friendly geo hashtag location
- Browse nearby issues using geo hashtag areas
- Vote and comment on issues
- Geographic hashtag filtering for relevant local issues

### Future Users (Later iterations)
- **Community Members**: Following local issues, getting notifications
- **Authorities**: When they want to engage, they can comment like any user
- **Organizers**: Advanced filtering and analysis tools (if needed)

The beauty is that users can help define what features are actually needed through usage patterns.

- **Location Privacy**: Only geo hashtags stored/transmitted - never precise GPS coordinates
- **User-Controlled Precision**: Choose your privacy level (1km, 5km+ geo hashtag areas)
- **No Location Tracking**: System cannot determine users' exact locations from geo hashtags
- **Moderation**: Leverage Bluesky's existing moderation tools and community guidelines
- **Blocking**: Users can block each other using standard Bluesky functionality

## Success Metrics (Keep It Simple)
