# Wukkie.uk - a bug tracker for the world

** oopsie woopsie de trein is stukkie wukkie... **

An ATProto project

Why do software projects have quality bug tracking and for world issues we are still dealing with slow and cumbersome political systems? While politicians have their place, I think we need a way to be able to take responsibility together for the problems we encounter around us. Wukkie.uk is a platform that allows users to report and track bugs and issues related to the world. It is designed to be a decentralized and open-source platform that anyone can use to report and track bugs and issues related to the world. Wukkie.uk is built on the ATProto protocol, which is a decentralized and open-source protocol for building decentralized applications.

## Features

- Decentralized and open-source platform
- Anyone can use to report and track bugs and issues related to the world
- Built on the ATProto protocol, which is a decentralized and open-source protocol for building decentralized applications

## Architecture

- Runs as just HTML on Cloudflare Workers
- Vibecoded together using public APIs and open-source libraries

## Relevancy through subject and location

I happen to also have invented the Local Hashtag system used by WhenWhere.uk. I plan to make this core and center to filing issues via Wukkie.uk so you should kinda automatically get more locally relevant issues for you first. Of course you should also be able to configure and search for preferred hashtags to find issues that are most relevant to the subjects that you care about.
